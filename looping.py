""" FOR LOOP """

# Much simpler and more rational in python

names = ["Emily", "Jack", "Sophia", "Ethan"]

for name in names:
    print(name)

""" WHILE LOOP """

num = 1

while num <= 10:
    print(num)
    # prints the numbers 1 through 10
    num += 1

# while loops are great for when you donâ€™t know how many times you will need to iterate - 
# for example if you want to continue getting input from a user until a specific condition is met.
# Beware of infinite loops!

""" The break and continue statements

Like in JavaScript, the 'break' statement in Python is used to exit for and while loops immediately.

the 'continue' statement will end the current iteration of a loop and continue to the next iteration as long as 
* the condition of the loop is still truthy
* there are still items to iterate through.
